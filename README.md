# Components Assignement

We will be creating a mock e-commerce store. In the `src/components` directory, you will find a file called `ProductCardContainer`. You will need to do:

1. Fix any syntax errors you find in the components
2. Move `ProductCard` into it's own file
3. Import `ProductCard` into `ProductCardContainer` add three products with dummy data
4. Import `ProductCardContainer` into `App.jsx`
5. Create a `NavBar` and `Footer` component and add it to `App.jsx`
