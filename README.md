# Components Assignement

We will be creating a mock e-commerce store. In the `src/components` directory, you will find a file called `ProductCardContainer`. You will need to do:

1. Create a git branch called `assignment-1` and checkout to it
2. Fix any syntax errors you find in the components
3. Move `ProductCard` into it's own file
4. Import `ProductCard` into `ProductCardContainer` add three products with dummy data
5. Import `ProductCardContainer` into `App.jsx`
6. Create a `NavBar` and `Footer` component and add it to `App.jsx`
7. Run `npm run dev` to validate your changes work
8. Push up your work to Github and open an PR to the master branch
