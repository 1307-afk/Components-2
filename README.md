# Conditional Rendering Assignement

We will be working on the navbar of our e-commerce store. You well need to do:

1. Add to the `NavBar` component a button and uses the `if` keyword to have it say `Login` when a user is not logged in and `Welcome back! You are logged in` when logged in
2. Use the ternary operator to indicate in the `ProductCard` component whether the product is in stock or out of stock
3. Use the logical AND operator (&&) in the `ProductCard` component to say `Sale! 20% off` only if the product is on sale
4. Set a variable called `shipped` in the `ProductCard` component to have a `span` element that says `Your order has been shipped!` or `Your order is being processed` if the order was shipped or not using the `if` keyword
5. Use the `shipped` variable in the returned jsx of the `ProductCard`
6. Push your code to GitHub and open a PR to branch `master`
